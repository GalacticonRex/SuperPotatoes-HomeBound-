"Kate" "% I’ve been on my own for a while. My brother was taking care of me until he got caught. Family services took me away from him and put me in some big home. It was pretty awful. I eventually managed to slip out and made my way back to where we used to live, but he was gone. I’m not exactly sure when waiting around turned into living, but I was making it on my own for a couple years. The city has really been going to hell lately though, and it was getting too hard to scrape by. I heard the colony has a lot of rich people in it, so I figured it’d be a much easier place to... uhh... get by on generous donations. Hey, what was your plan by the way?" % Response
	"That guy in a uniform said I should try to get someone to take me in."
		Response = "You’re little enough, that might just work."
		=> "C4 c1 5"
	"I’m going to try to make it on my own."
		Response = "You’re pretty small, no offense or anything, a lot littler than when I had to start on my own. I hope you can come up with something else."
		=> "C4 c1 4"
	"I don’t have one."

	"Well that guy in a uniform said I should try to get someone to take me in. I just don’t know about that though."
		Response = "You know, that might not be the worst idea, just until you can get out on your own. Some of these people aren’t half bad."
		=> "C4 c1 5"
	"Maybe you could help me? I don’t really know what I’m doing."
		Response = "Yeah... of course. I’ll show you the ropes and all."

"Kate" "That’s Francois. He’s rough, but harmless. He’s the only crew member who has come in here, I think because they’re trying to keep this whole thing on the downlow."

"Kate" "Oh, the Worthingtons. The parents are kind of toolbags. They’re uptight and don’t want their kids getting mixed up in the riffraff like us. If you’re disgustingly polite to them, they not quite as nasty. The kids on the other hand are alright, even if they are incredibly spoiled. Vincent takes after her folks a little, but Anton seems like a sweet kid still."

"Kate" "Oh Dr. Kapoor? He’s crazy. I only know he speaks English because I heard him arguing with someone before we got on the ship. It sounded like he didn’t actually want to get on, not sure why though. He hasn’t said a peep since we got on though. Good luck if you try to get anything out of him."

"Kate" "To be honest, no. I've heard a lot of rumors though, and it's a little hard to tell the difference between hopes and facts there. It's at least safe from the war, that's for sure. If it's actually as comfortable and prosperous as everyone says, well I guess we'll just have to find out."
	"I want to ask something else."

"Kate" "Yeah that's a bad plan, pip. I was a few years older when I had to start living on the streets, and I don't think I'd have made it if I were your age. Still, I'm not going to say no if you have no other options. At least try to figure something else out for now."
